project_euler
=============

This repository will serve as a centeral hub for the work I do on Project Euler problems. I work on these problems anywhere, whenever I get a few spare minutes, so remembering which of my computers contains the most recent version of a file was becoming a problem.  Collecting everything here seemes like the most elegant solution.  

All of my solutions up to this point have used Python, but I think it would be fun later to retry some of them in a different language.  So stay tuned.

I love feedback, so if you have any intersting suggestions or comments about my methods send them my way!

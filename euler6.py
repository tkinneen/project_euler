# Description: The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
#
#    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
#
#    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
# numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 26.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
# natural numbers and the square of the sum.
